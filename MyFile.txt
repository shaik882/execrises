After Four month i started again today to continue my journey into mastering python, i am a software engineer by degree
After completing my engineering i have never worked on any projects and completed it. I need some sort of motivation to
master this skill.
Today again i start fresh as i don't fell confident of programing again.
Problems
1. Lack of focus
2. Lack of commitment in learning this skill
3. Lack of ambition - no idea where i am heading professionally
4. I am bare minimum as per my skill - currently earning 1000 USD every month
5. I am not focused on family as well - don't take care of kids or wife properly

So i decided and promised to my self that from today onwards i will try to do my best in my life and be focused on
my life which is  good for this world or next world

4:26 AM - No youtube, No Facebook other than using for it my benefit - to gain knowledge and learn
I need to work 30 hours a week - promised - tickets, incidents, callouts
I need to work 30 hours a week - promised - Python
This is plan as if now - will modify accordingly

#Thrid attempt to learn python - 08-06-2021
I have been quit bit of time since last time when worked on my programming skills and it have lots of time wasted in day dreaming
I think i lack motivation to learn this skill.
I have plans to change the job as well, next profile will be devops - network devops - ansible
It has been more than one year now, i have trying to learn the Python programming but failing due to lack of focus.
USE TIME WILL ALLAH ALSO COUNTS THE TIME HE GAVE ME IN THIS WORLD.
